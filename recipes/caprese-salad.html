    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This caprese salad features tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil drizzled with a sweet balsamic reduction and olive oil. 
        Easy, impressive, and delicious! Most grocery stores now sell prepared balsamic reductions. Surprisingly it's just as good!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>3 large tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir balsamic vinegar and honey together in a small saucepan and place over high heat. 
            Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until mixture has reduced to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. 
            Set aside to cool.</li>

        <li>Arrange alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella decoratively on a serving platter. 
            Sprinkle with salt and black pepper, tuck basil leaves around slices, and drizzle with olive oil and the balsamic reduction.</li>
    </ol>
